1. Trained network with two hidden layers of 400 units and no noise to learn one sentence. ~900 epochs.
best mse:
python trained_model_one_sentence.py server /space/cdrw/new/benchmark 0.07 0.0 False 0

Result: Failure. The network is not able to reproduce the sentence (generating with no noise)

2. Train same network but with learning rate starting at 0.03
best train mse: 0.000024
best restart mse: 1.44167598318
epochs: ~5560
python trained_model_one_sentence.py server /space/cdrw/new/benchmark 0.03 0.0 False 0 &

Result: Model can reproduce ~2000 samples if started in the middle (not if started at first frame)

3. Train same network but longer
best mse: 0.000132
best retasrt mse: 1.74897282256
epochs: ~6200
python trained_model_one_sentence.py server /space/cdrw/new/benchmark 0.07 0.0 False 0

Result: Model can reproduce ~500 (?) samples if started in the middle (not if started at first frame)

4. Train network with broadband noise of magnitude 0.3

python trained_model_one_sentence.py server /space/cdrw/new/onesentnoise 1.0 0.0 0.3 0

5. Train network with broadband noise of random magnitude [0 - 1.0]

python trained_model_one_sentence.py server /space/cdrw/new/onesentnoise 1.0 0 [0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9] 0

6. Train network with broadband noise of random magnitude [0 - 1.0] decay towards most recent sample

7. Train network predicting 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 samples

8. Train network with noise with spectrum of sentence

9. Train network with noise with spectrum of sentence and decaying towards end
